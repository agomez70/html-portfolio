<h1>The Best Movies According to Andres</h1>

<h2>My top three movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Veronica</h3>

<p>This is by far the best horror movie out there. It is based on a teenage girl who summommed
    an evil spirit by using a Ouiji Board to contact her deceased father. The movie is based on a 
    true event that occurred in Spain. 
</p>

<h3>Hacksaw Ridge</h3>

<p>This movie is based on Desmond Doss, an Army enlisted medical soldier that battle through the 
    the battle of Hacksaw Ridge in Okinawa, Japan. He was a concious denier (I think that's what 
    it's called) which meant that he chose not to use, carry or be involved in any way with a 
    rifle. He eneded saving over 50 lives wihtout killing a single Japanese soldier
</p>

<h3>Coach Carter</h3>

<p>Coach Carter was a high school basketball coach and that also played for Richmond High school.
    Richmond high had a community of at risk youth and Coach Carter, aside from being a winning 
    basketball coach, he also saved a lot of the youth from imprisoment, death and ultimately, 
    gave the youth a chance of survival through life.
